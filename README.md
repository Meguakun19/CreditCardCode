# CreditCardCode
Java homework. This is a code to replicate the functionality of a credit card. I personally wrote the classes "CreditCard" and "Money", in order to run my code within the classes "CreditCardDemo" and "MoneyDemo", while simultaneously utilizing necessary information from other classes.
